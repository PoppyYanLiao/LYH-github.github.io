    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As a major channel for information dissemination, broadcasting has a history spanning over a century and has always played an irreplaceable role. Over the past decade, text-to-speech (TTS) technology based on deep learning has gradually emerged and achieved numerous successes in the Chinese domain. Many radio stations have introduced speech synthesis models into the production of news broadcasting programs to improve production efficiency. However, the application of these technologies in more relaxed and natural entertainment programs remains relatively limited.
This paper is based on the BERT-VITS model. We first use a large open-source dataset with a prosodic style biased towards news broadcasting to train the TTS model. We then transfer the model to a smaller dataset with a more relaxed and natural prosodic style. The purpose of the experiment is to investigate the impact of fine-tuning and further training with datasets of different prosodic styles on the model's output audio prosody after the initial training. We aim to create more diverse prosodic styles for broadcasting programs by combining the BERT-VITS model with datasets of different prosodic styles, thereby enriching the types of artificial intelligence (AI) broadcasting. Our experimental results show that the system can flexibly change the target voice timbre according to the reference speech. Even with limited data training, it can synthesize speech that matches the target speaker's prosody and style. The generated speech has good naturalness and inference speed, making it suitable for broadcasting content.</p>
